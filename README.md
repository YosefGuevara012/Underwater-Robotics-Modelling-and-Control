## Overview
This project involves the development and validation of a mathematical model for the Sparus II Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The model incorporates various dynamics and control aspects, including the computation of mass matrices, added mass, and drag matrices, aiming to enhance the understanding of AUV behavior and improve control strategies.

## Objective
The primary goal is to establish an accurate mathematical model that encapsulates the rigid body dynamics of a 6 Degree of Freedom (DOF) underwater vehicle. This includes calculating system inertia, damping equations, and simulating the AUV's response to different control inputs and environmental conditions.

## Key Features
- **Mass Matrix Computation:** Calculation of mass matrices for the AUV's main body and components to understand their distribution and effects on the vehicle's dynamics.
- **Added Mass Computation:** Evaluation of the added mass effect due to the displacement of water, crucial for accurate dynamic modeling.
- **Drag Matrix Computation:** Analysis of drag forces acting on the AUV and their impact on motion and control.
- **Simulation:** Implementation of simulations to validate the model against real-world behaviors and to study the AUV's response to various scenarios.
- **Control Strategies:** Exploration of control strategies to improve the AUV's operational efficiency and adaptability to environmental changes.
